Tumblog theme for Waveapps engineering blog


## Instructions


1. This is what you have to add in the HTML for the “Posted by” section to appear at the bottom of the post. This has to be added after your posts content

    <div class="author">
        <div class="authorportrait"><img src="https://sample-photo-url.jpg" /></div>
        <div class="postedby">Posted by</div>
        <br />
        <div class="authorname">Author Name</div>
        <br />
        <div class="authorabout">Author About</div>
    </div>

2. While the theme does not show notes for the posts, we should add relevant ones when posting fresh posts anyway because they help with search, both on the blog and when someone searches for those keywords on Google etc.


## TODO
Most of this work was done in short bursts over the course of ~1 month. Styling changes will likely happen every now and then, but some major features that need to be added:
    1. Related posts on Permalink pages
    2. A better way of handling adding author details that is not via HTML on posts
    3. Display most recent tweet from @WaveHQ in the left nav
    4. Opening up "Asks" to developers and designers in the startup community
    5. Adding some sort of commenting functionality
